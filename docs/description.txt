terkait uses semantic services to analyze the content on your webpage in order to present related content, e.g., images, videos or news articles to you. By default, the top 5 relevant entities that have been extracted are shown and filtered for persons and places which can be configured through the options pane.

In the current version, terkait works best on english news articles and english webpages that deal with politics, sports and topics about music. However, we are currently working to broaden the field of application of terkait and make it more useful for you.

## Attention ##
terkait never sends information to any services without your permission. This means that it only starts to send content to services after you have pressed the icon in the browser - or triggered the analysis via the context menu of selected text. By default, the content from secure webpages (https://..) is never send to the backend service. This can also be configured via the options menu.
